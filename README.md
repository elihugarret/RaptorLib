RaptorLibs
====

Millions years ago the dinosaurs roamed the earth...

The RaptorLibs are experimental libraries/modules written in Lua by Elihú Garret.

I wrote these libraries for a livecoding workshop at Escuela Superior de Física y Matematicas (Superior School of Physics and Mathemathics) in the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (National Polytechnic Institute) (México).

Introduction
======
RaptorLibs are modules for sequencing and manipulating sound (synthesis and samples) in Lua. Inspired by Alex McLean's Tidal http://yaxu.org/tidal/ and Thor Magnusson's Ixi Lang https://github.com/thormagnusson/ixilang

How it works? -- Basically, i wrote a lot of functions and nerdy stuff using the Gerald Franz's proteaAudio Lua API for synthesis and sample manipulation.

Live coding is possible if you use the "live coding function" in Paul Kulchenko's ZeroBrane StudioIDE. http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/live-coding-in-lua-bret-victor-style
